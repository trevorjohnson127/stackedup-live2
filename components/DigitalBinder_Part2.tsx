          content: `üîç What it is:
Strategic reallocation of capital from lower-conviction or underperforming positions into stronger, more aligned opportunities.

üß† Why it matters:
Every dollar sitting in a ‚Äúdead‚Äù position is missing a better job elsewhere. Rotating correctly is how you scale without adding more cash.

üõ† How to apply:
- Identify underperformers or low-conviction stocks (check Red Flag Mode, Confidence Curve)
- Look for better opportunities in your binder (watchlist, high conviction, core assets)
- Use upgrade logic: rotate INTO strategy, not just OUT of pain
- Use springboards carefully to gain faster access to core assets

üìå Strategy tie-in:
Part of your system‚Äôs efficiency loop. Keep your portfolio sharp by rotating based on role, conviction, and momentum ‚Äî not emotion.`,

          title: 'Exit Strategy ‚Äî Pg 6',
          content: `üîç What it is:
Pre-planned sell logic. Designed to eliminate emotion and protect profits, while exiting losers at controlled thresholds.

üß† Why it matters:
Most investors don't know when to sell. They chase gains too long or hold losers too deep. This protects both ends.

üõ† How to apply:
- Gains: Trim or rotate around +20% (depending on role and conviction)
- Losses: Consider partial trim at -10%, full exit at -15% or if thesis breaks
- Always ask: "Is this still fulfilling its role in my strategy?"

üìå Strategy tie-in:
This system isn‚Äôt just about what to buy ‚Äî it's about what to exit and when. Use binder conviction levels + rotation targets.`,
        },
        {
          title: 'Tax Optimization ‚Äî Pg 7',
          content: `üîç What it is:
Using account types and timing rules to legally reduce or defer taxes while building long-term wealth.

üß† Why it matters:
More gain = more taxes if unmanaged. But your Roth, ETFs, and hold timing can turn those taxes into $0.

üõ† How to apply:
- Roth IRA: Use for long-term growth and never pay tax again
- ETFs: Favor them in taxable accounts (like SCHD, SPYG) ‚Äî fewer taxable events
- Avoid short-term trades in brokerage unless it's part of a high-conviction move
- Don‚Äôt obsess over taxes if it conflicts with strategy ‚Äî priority is strong positioning

üìå Strategy tie-in:
Your binder includes Roth-focused guidance and allocation logic. Use each account like a role in the team ‚Äî tax-wise.`,

          title: 'Allocation Framework ‚Äî Pg 8',
          content: `üîç What it is:
System for organizing your portfolio by role. Ensures balance between growth, stability, and opportunity.

üß† Why it matters:
Without clear roles, your portfolio becomes scattered. This framework gives every dollar a job.

üõ† How to apply:
- Core: ETFs like SPYG or VTI
- Growth: Conviction stocks like AAPL, ELV
- Springboards: Tactical stocks (TSLA, ROKU) with strict rules
- Defensive: SCHD or ROL
- Optional: Wildcard growth, watchlist trackers

üìå Strategy tie-in:
This layout appears across your system: on the homepage, in rotation rules, and during allocation planning. It's your portfolio map.`,

          title: 'Buy the Dip Blueprint ‚Äî Pg 9',
          content: `üîç What it is:
Strategic timing guide for entering red days or pullbacks ‚Äî especially for high-conviction positions.

üß† Why it matters:
Most people rush dips too early or freeze. This gives you edge, patience, and logic.

üõ† How to apply:
- Ideal buy window: 1:00‚Äì3:50pm ET
- Enter only when conviction is high and price action confirms
- Never buy early on panic ‚Äî use intraday patience
- Watch for sector flushes or multi-day drops
- Use the timer tool (if live) for alerts during dip hours

üìå Strategy tie-in:
This strategy lives in your Dip Timer, Roth entry plan, and watchlist alerts. It prevents emotion-driven entries.`,
